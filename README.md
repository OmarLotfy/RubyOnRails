I create a new simple project everyday, illustrate some ruby magic and I take a snapshot from the code and comments over it, this approach makes my task even more challenging.

hope my projects gets you inspired at your work, or even makes you jealous and port them, enhance them, or even create your own ideas,

feel free to fork this repository and enhance whatever you want, just show the world how you code.
